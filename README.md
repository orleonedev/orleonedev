# üí´üëæüì± About Me:
Hello, I‚Äôm Oreste Leone, iOS Engineer and Game Developer with a background in Computer Science at University of Naples Federico II, and I'm based in Naples, Italy.

Being a member of Lapse Games, a small Indie Game Development Team, so far has been an exciting journey. We achieved significant milestones with the Lapse Trilogy, which has garnered over 15 million downloads on both the App Store and Google Play. My role involved conceptualizing the trilogy and collaborating with the team and external freelancers to create engaging and intuitive gaming experiences.

Today I‚Äôm also working as an iOS Engineer thanks to the experiences made at the Apple Developer Academy @UNINA, first as a student, and then as an App Developer in the Pier Program, developing an internal tool aimed at enhancing the leaning journey inside all developer academies. I was also awarded in the WWDC22 and WWDC23 editions of the Swift Student Challenge and developed apps and games that are available on the App Store.

With hands-on experience in the both industries, I‚Äôm passionate about mentoring others about every aspect of the game development journey and sharing my knowledge. My dream is to create a wide community of Italian game developers to greatly increase the industry in our country. 

If you're interested in connecting or discussing opportunities in Game or iOS development, I‚Äôm happy to hear more!
