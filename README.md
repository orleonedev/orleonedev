# üí´ About Me:
Hello, I‚Äôm Oreste Leone, a Software and Game Developer. I have a strong background in Computer Science currently pursuing my bachelor's degree at University of Naples Federico II, and I'm based in Naples, Italy.<br>With hands-on experience as a Unity Developer and Game Designer, I have contributed to various projects, collaborating with professionals as Freelancer in development of cross platform apps and consulting.<br><br>Being a member of Lapse Games, a small Indie Game Development Team, has been an exciting journey. We achieved significant milestones with the Lapse Trilogy, which has garnered over 15 million downloads on both the App Store and Google Play. My role involved conceptualizing the trilogy and collaborating with the team and external freelancers to create engaging and intuitive gaming experiences.<br><br>After graduating from the Apple Developer Academy @UNINA, where I learned about Software Development, Entrepreneurship, App Design, and Game Creation in native Apple Platforms, I am currently enrolled in the Pier Program, where I'm developing a SwiftUI macOS app for the "mark" project. During this program, I've honed my skills in iOS Development and enhanced my soft skills while collaborating with stakeholders to meet their requirements. Thanks to these experiences, I was awarded in the WWDC22 and WWDC23 editions of the Swift Student Challenge and developed apps and games that are available on the App Store.<br><br>I am a proactive and dedicated professional, passionate about mentoring and creating valuable learning resources that helped junior learners in their game development journey with iOS native frameworks and Unity Engine. I enjoy collaborating with teams and thrive in dynamic environments. If you're interested in connecting or discussing opportunities in coding, iOS app development, or Game development, please reach out.
